Description of the program: This program takes the data set that I have provided and
searches through the data set for the ages of the players and the points they have.
The program takes everyone in the same age group, and finds the average points
that the age group has. Continues doing that for each age group. Then it displays
a graph of the age of the players and what someone in the age group there average 
points would be.

Algorithm:

    input- The input is the CSV file and the program reads that file and this is the
    information that will be used throughout the program.
    
    Processing- the main function calls the average function and inputs data
    into the average. Data has all the data from the CSV file saved. The average takes
    that information and looks for two things the ages and the points that age got.
    The program sorts per age group averages the number of points per age group and
    saves that information. Then it prints the age group and the corresponding average score.
    
    output- The output is all the information that is printed out from average along
    with a graph of that data.
